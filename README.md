# Hashtopussy Bcrypt Generic Cracker

Generic cracker example which is compatible with Hashtopussy.

Slightly adjusted from the main version to be able to crack bcrypt hashes. Bcrypt implementation is taken from https://github.com/trusch/libbcrypt

**Note**: The bcrypt implementation seems to have a problem with compiling on Windows, but it works on Linux and OS X.
